## Motivation

As a perfectionist and user of different PCs and operating systems, I want to optimize my muscle memory for mouse movement by making sure that the conditions are exactly equal everywhere.
To diagnose mouse issues, I used to play the flash game Disc Dash from [Respawned!](http://www.respawned.co.uk/).
While a low score shows me that a configuration is clearly wrong, it doesn't tell me what the exact problem is.
Also, a slightly different configuration might lead to a similar score but impact my muscle memory on the default configuration.
Finally, I don't want to install Flash everywhere.
Achieve a cross-platform solution with easy access, I developed a HTML/JavaScript mouse diagnostic tool.
